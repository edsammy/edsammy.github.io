This project is a network of wireless heart rate monitors to be used in ad-hoc recovery rooms following disaster scenarios. The wireless monitors, or nodes, are placed on patients and determine their heart rate using [photoplethysmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram). The data sent from each node is viewed on a nearby laptop where medical personnel can monitor patients and be alerted of any abnormal activity.

The project is dubbed WAMPUM for **W**ireless **A**ggregating **M**ultinode, **PU**lse **M**onitor.

Created with [Jeremy Warner](http://jeremywrnr.com/project/wampum/), Jae Min Choi, and Ivy Racquel for senior design at the University of Rochester.
